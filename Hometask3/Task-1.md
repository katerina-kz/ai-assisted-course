### Prompt

- Concept of function: I need to generate functional programming code based on specific requirements I provide.
- Function requirements: The function should check a created password for compliance with security levels, 
  according to validation rules: the length must be 8-15 characters, the password must contain both uppercase and lowercase 
  Latin letters, as well as digits and special symbols. The password is a required field. If even one rule is not met, the function should return the corresponding validation message. If multiple rules are not followed, then multiple messages should be returned. If the password is entered correctly, a success message should be displayed.
- Function complexity: The function should be simple and straightforward.
- Error handling: If even one rule is not met, the function should return the corresponding validation message.
- Function signature: The function name should be 'checkPassword', that checks the entered data for compliance with the requirements
- Function logic: 
  - The password length must be between 8 and 15 characters. 
  - The password must contain both uppercase and lowercase Latin letters. 
  - The password must include a digit. 
  - The password must include a special symbol. 
  - The Password is required.
- Example inputs and outputs: 
```
{
  isValid: true / false,
  message: validation message
}
```
- Code style and formatting: The function should have proper indentation and comments explaining the code.

Based on these requirements, could you generate a function?

### ChatGPT Solution

Here is a function that checks a password based on the specified security levels. I've kept the logic simple and added detailed comments explaining the code.

```javascript
// Function to check if a password meets the specified security requirements
function checkPassword(password) {
  const errors = [];

  // Check if password is provided
  if (!password) {
    return {
      isValid: false,
      message: 'Password is required'
    };
  }

  // Check if password length is between 8 and 15 characters
  if (password.length < 8 || password.length > 15) {
    errors.push('Password must be between 8 and 15 characters long');
  }

  // Check if password contains at least one lowercase letter
  if (!/[a-z]/.test(password)) {
    errors.push('Password must contain at least one lowercase letter');
  }

  // Check if password contains at least one uppercase letter
  if (!/[A-Z]/.test(password)) {
    errors.push('Password must contain at least one uppercase letter');
  }

  // Check if password contains at least one digit
  if (!/\d/.test(password)) {
    errors.push('Password must contain at least one digit');
  }

  // Check if password contains at least one special symbol
  if (!/[!@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>]/.test(password)) {
    errors.push('Password must contain at least one special character');
  }

  // If there are any errors, return them
  if (errors.length > 0) {
    return {
      isValid: false,
      message: errors.join(', ')
    };
  }

  // If no errors, return success message
  return {
    isValid: true,
    message: 'Password is valid'
  };
}

// Example usage:
console.log(checkPassword('Password123!'));  // { isValid: true, message: 'Password is valid' }
console.log(checkPassword('pass'));          // { isValid: false, message: 'Password must be between 8 and 15 characters long, Password must contain at least one uppercase letter, Password must contain at least one digit, Password must contain at least one special character' }
```

### Explanation:
1. **Password is required**: If no password is provided, the function immediately returns a message that it's required.
2. **Validation Rules**: Each rule (length, case, digit, special character) is checked one by one. If the rule is violated, an error message is pushed to the `errors` array.
3. **Return Values**:
    - If there are any validation errors, the function returns an object with `isValid: false` and a combined error message.
    - If all rules are satisfied, the function returns `isValid: true` with a success message.

This approach ensures that the function provides meaningful feedback while keeping the implementation simple.
