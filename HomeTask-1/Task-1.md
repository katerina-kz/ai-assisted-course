### Prompt:

## Can you help generate functional and non-functional requirements based on the following information:

 - Purpose of the system: The system is designed to be an existing web application for property bookings
 - Key features: Introduce an "Instant Booking" feature where renters can instantly book available properties without waiting for owner approval.
 - User roles:
    - Property owners:  should be able to toggle this feature on or off for their listings.
    - Renters: should be able to filter search results to only show instantly bookable properties.
- Performance expectations: The system should support up to 100 concurrent users without performance degradation. Task updates should reflect in real-time.
- Security needs: Security, especially in terms of payment processing, remains a priority.
- Usability: The interface addition should seamlessly integrate with our current user interface, ensuring an intuitive experience
- Technology preferences: The application should be developed using JavaScript, with React for front-end development and Node.js for the back end.
- Edge cases:
Potential edge cases to consider are simultaneous instant bookings of the same property and handling instant bookings when a property's availability suddenly changes.

### ChatGPT's feedback:

Here are the functional and non-functional requirements based on the information you provided:
Functional Requirements:
1. Instant Booking Toggle for Property Owners:
    * Property owners should have the ability to enable or disable the "Instant Booking" feature for each of their listed properties.
2. Filtering by Instant Booking for Renters:
    * Renters should be able to filter search results to only display properties that are available for instant booking.
3. Real-time Updates:
    * All changes to property availability and booking statuses should reflect in real-time for both renters and owners.
4. Handling Simultaneous Bookings:
    * The system should prevent two users from instant booking the same property at the same time by implementing a locking mechanism to reserve the property during the booking process.
5. Error Handling for Availability Changes:
    * If a property’s availability changes while a renter is in the process of booking it, the system should notify the renter and prevent the booking from proceeding.
6. Payment Processing:
    * Renters should be able to securely process payments for instant bookings through the system, adhering to secure payment standards.
Non-Functional Requirements:
1. Performance:
    * The system should support up to 100 concurrent users without any performance degradation, ensuring fast response times and real-time updates.
2. Scalability:
    * The system architecture should be scalable to accommodate future growth, allowing an increase in concurrent users if needed.
3. Security:
    * Security of the payment processing system should be prioritized, complying with industry-standard security protocols (e.g., PCI DSS compliance).
    * Implement protection against common security threats such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
4. Usability:
    * The "Instant Booking" feature and its corresponding UI elements should integrate seamlessly into the existing interface, offering an intuitive user experience.
    * The system should offer clear feedback to users about the booking status and availability changes in real-time.
5. Technology Stack:
    * The system should use JavaScript, with React for the front-end development and Node.js for the back-end development.
6. Reliability:
    * The system should ensure high availability, with minimal downtime to allow uninterrupted access to property bookings.
7. Edge Case Handling:
    * Implement mechanisms to handle edge cases such as simultaneous booking attempts, last-minute availability changes, and race conditions.
